    That was exactly what transpired between me and Sumayyah while I was still an Arabic teacher at Usool madrasah in Agege Lagos.
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    But I didn't just blow the blunder and ended it there. No! I went as far as arguing with my 6-year girl, Sumayyah, turning in all my energy to drive home my point that I was absolutely correct!
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    I remember asking Sumayyah to prove it to me that "why did you cAme late" was wrong, or was that not a past tense?
  </p>
  <p class="p-text-block">
    She says she can't prove it but all she knows is that English is not spoken that way.
